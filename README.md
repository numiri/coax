# coax
a math-aware replacement for pencil-paper to work algebra problems by handwriting.
 
Here's a video demo of the app in action.  http://tessm.modstein.com:9089/snguyen/web/ours/html/demo.mp4

Until I figure out how to use github properly, you can get the code here http://tessm.modstein.com:9089/snguyen/web/ours/html/coax-0.8.tar

Handwriting recognizer:  We use a 3rd party handwriting engine from Mathpix and you will need a key.  You can use mine for free on a trial basis, or get one from Mathpix (they charge about .005usd per web call).

Licensing addendum:
You may use this software in accordance of the GPL license.  In addition, you must reserve a square area on the screen  the size of max( 1 cm^2, 2% of screen size ) for a link devoted to math education
